# Design Task 4: Evaluation of Design Tools (Task1, Task2)

## 1. Introduction
This report evaluates the two design tools used in the Design phase of the project:
- **Figma**, used for the GUI design (Task 1)
- **Canva**, used for Activity and Class Diagrams (Task 2)

The evaluation is based on the three required quality areas:
- Output Quality  
- Usability  
- Output Trustworthiness  

The goal is to compare the performance of these tools and determine which tool is more suitable for each design task.

## 2. Evaluation Criteria

### 2.1 Output Quality  
Assesses clarity, professional appearance, structure, and level of detail.

### 2.2 Usability  
Measures how easy the tool is to learn, navigate, and work with.

### 2.3 Output Trustworthiness  
Evaluates consistency, reliability, and accuracy of the produced outputs.

## 3.1 Figma (Used for GUI Design)

### Output Quality  
Figma provides high-fidelity UI components, precise alignment, auto-layout, and industry-standard prototyping features.  
The generated GUI screens are detailed, consistent, and visually accurate.

**Score:** 5/5

### Usability  
The tool is intuitive and supports efficient design through drag-and-drop components, reusable styles, and powerful layout tools.  
A short learning curve is required, but workflow becomes fast afterward.

**Score:** 4/5

### Output Trustworthiness  
Figma ensures stable, predictable, and structured outputs.  
Spacing, alignment, and components remain consistent across all screens.

**Score:** 5/5

## 3.2 Canva (Used for Activity & Class Diagrams)

### Output Quality  
Canva produces clean and aesthetically pleasing diagrams.  
Its templates are well-structured for flowcharts and diagrams, making it effective for Activity and Class Diagram creation.  
However, Canva lacks strict UML notation support.

**Score:** 4/5

### Usability  
Very easy to use with minimal learning required.  
Drag-and-drop elements, icons, and templates significantly speed up diagram creation.

**Score:** 4/5

### Output Trustworthiness  
The output is visually clear, but since Canva does not enforce UML standards, the correctness relies on the designer’s manual accuracy.

**Score:** 3/5

## 4. Comparative Analysis

### Key Observation
During the design process, I observed that each tool excels in different areas:

- **Figma performed significantly better for GUI design**  
  because it provides detailed, precise, and structured UI components that allow the creation of realistic and professional interface layouts.

- **Canva performed better for diagram design (Activity & Class)**  
  because its template-oriented environment makes it easier and faster to build diagrams, even though it is not a UML-strict tool.

### Summary Table

| Quality Area        | Figma (GUI) | Canva (Diagrams) | Better Tool |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Output Quality      | 5/5         | 4/5               | Figma       |
| Usability           | 4/5         | 4/5               | Tie         |
| Output Trustworthiness | 5/5      | 3/5               | Figma       |

**Conclusion:**  
- **Figma is the superior tool for GUI prototyping**, providing the highest level of detail and accuracy.  
- **Canva is the better tool for diagramming**, thanks to its convenient and accessible template library.  
- Both tools complement each other well for the design phase of the project.

## 5. Final Evaluation
Overall, Figma and Canva contributed effectively to different parts of the design workflow.  
Figma enabled the creation of a consistent and professional GUI layout, while Canva simplified and accelerated the development of Activity and Class Diagrams.

Both tools supported the project successfully, but **Figma delivered higher output quality and trustworthiness**, whereas **Canva offered greater convenience and speed for diagrams**.
